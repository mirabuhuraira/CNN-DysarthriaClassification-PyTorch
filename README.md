# CNN-DysarthriaClassification-PyTorch
This repository implements dysarthria classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch. The model classifies dysarthric and non-dysarthric speech from audio data transformed into log-mel spectrograms. It includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation for detecting speech impairments.
